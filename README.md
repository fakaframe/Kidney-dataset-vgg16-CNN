Kidney Disease Classification
This repository contains a project for classifying kidney disease using medical images. The model leverages deep learning architectures, including VGG16 and a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to predict the presence of kidney disease from the dataset obtained from Kaggle.

📂 Dataset
The dataset used for this project was sourced from Kaggle and includes images of kidneys, labeled based on the presence or absence of disease.

Source: Kidney Disease Dataset on Kaggle
Data Format: Images in .jpg or .png format, labeled into two classes: Healthy and Diseased.
🧠 Models Used
VGG16:
Pre-trained VGG16 model with ImageNet weights.
Fine-tuned on the kidney disease dataset to adapt the model for specific classification needs.
Custom CNN:
A custom-built Convolutional Neural Network designed to classify kidney disease.
Includes multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

🚀 How to Use
Data Preparation:

Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the data/ directory.
Run the data_preprocessing.ipynb notebook to preprocess the images and split them into training, validation, and test sets.
Model Training:

Open model_training.ipynb and run the cells to train the models (VGG16 and Custom CNN).
The trained models are saved in the models/ directory.
Prediction:

Use the predict.py script to make predictions on new images:
bash
Copy code
python predict.py --model models/vgg16_model.h5 --image path/to/image.jpg
📈 Results
Model	Accuracy
VGG16	92.5%
Custom CNN	89.3%
The VGG16 model outperformed the custom CNN model, likely due to the benefit of pre-trained weights from ImageNet.
🔍 Evaluation
The models were evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Confusion matrices and ROC curves are available in the model_evaluation.ipynb notebook.
🛠️ Future Improvements
Experiment with other pre-trained models like ResNet50 and EfficientNet.
Apply techniques like data augmentation to improve model generalization.
Explore ensemble methods to combine the strengths of multiple models.
